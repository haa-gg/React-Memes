# What is this?

It's a mme generator that uses the flipimg API and React to spit up hot, fresh memes.

## Why?

Isn't the internet already chock full of meme generators? Yep! The real reason I built this was it made sense as something to build to see how apps, components and states all work together.

### How do you make it work if you download it?
1) Clone the git repo
2) Rebuild the secrets.js file
3) Run `npm start` in the repo
4) Make some memes!
